# Learning from Bob Nystrom's "Crafting Interpreters"

This repository is part of my journey to learn about building interpreters from scratch, following Bob Nystrom's book **"Crafting Interpreters"**. 

Currently, the project contains a **Java-based interpreter** (`Jlox`), which is the first interpreter built in the book.

## What Iâ€™m Learning
- Writing an interpreter in **Java**.
- Understanding parsing, abstract syntax trees (ASTs), and evaluation.
- Gaining hands-on experience with language implementation.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Follow the instructions in the `jlox` directory to build and run the Java interpreter.
